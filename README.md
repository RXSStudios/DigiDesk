It’s a desk, not a feature overload.

📦 Installation & First-Time Setup (Important)

Windows may show a warning when you open new unsigned EXE files.
Here’s how to run DigiDesk safely:

🛠 Option 1 — Allow From the Defender Pop-Up

When the Windows Defender SmartScreen pop-up appears:

Click More Info

Press Run Anyway

That’s it.

🛠 Option 2 — Add DigiDesk as an Exclusion (Recommended)
