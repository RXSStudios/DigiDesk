📦 Installation & First-Time Setup (Important)

Windows may show a warning when you open new unsigned EXE files. Here’s how to run DigiDesk safely:

🛠 Option 1 — Allow From the Defender Pop-Up

When the Windows Defender SmartScreen pop-up appears:

Click More Info

Press Run Anyway

That’s it.

🛠 Option 2 — Add DigiDesk as an Exclusion (Recommended)

Open Windows Security

Go to Virus & Threat Protection

Click Manage Settings

Scroll down to Exclusions

Click Add or remove exclusions

Add your entire DigiDesk folder (where the EXE is located)

After this, DigiDesk will run smoothly without any interruptions.
